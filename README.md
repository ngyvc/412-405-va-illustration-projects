### Differences between Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts Design

The distinction between Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts can
be a little tricky to grasp, initially. Both styles developed at approximately
the same time, and both are associated with an appreciation of the natural
world. There are several major differences, however, that render the styles
quite different in philosophy, design, and focus.

Understanding the differences between Art Nouveau and Arts
and Crafts is important to getting either design style right. While there’s
always a little overlap between contemporary styles, knowing the clear
boundaries of each can only benefit a home designer. Here’s a few major areas
that will help you tell Arts and Crafts design from Art Nouveau.

#### Elegance Vs. Romanticism

One of the fastest ways to tell if an object is Arts and
Crafts or Art Nouveau is to study how complex the design is. Arts and Crafts
design focuses on simplicity; lines tend to be elongated, shapes stretched, and
details minimized to their basic form. In this way, it resembles earlier forms
such as neoclassicism.


In Art Nouveau, however, the emphasis is on a romantic,
exaggerated portrayal. Hailing from styles such as baroque and rococo design,
Art Nouveau artistry tends to feature elaboration on a natural form. Vines and
flowers are often elaborately detailed with curlicues and flourishes, while in
Arts and Crafts, they might be created either as realistic or elegantly
simplified.

#### Color Considerations

Since both styles focus heavily on the natural world as an
influence, it’s not surprising to find that color palettes for both draw their
inspiration from nature. However, Arts and Crafts design
tends to emphasize natural colors in their most basic form, leaning toward neutrals,
whereas Art Nouveau typically enhances the drama of natural colors with more
saturated hues.

For example, in a depiction of a field of wheat, an Arts and
Crafts design might choose a medium yellow tone that closely matches the real,
true color of actual wheat. In an Art Nouveau piece, by contrast, the color of
the wheat might be deepened or saturated to emphasize its glowing effect, or
even rendered in a metallic shade like gold or copper for an even stronger
look.

#### Reality Vs. Drama

Overall, the differences between the two styles can be
summarized by their differing points of view. Art Nouveau seeks to glory the
beauty of nature by dramatizing it, hoping to create a strong emotional impact
through detail and saturation. Arts and Crafts, on the other hand, attempts to
praise nature by depicting its simple beauty.

By keeping these divergent philosophies in mind, even a
novice designer will quickly find themselves able to distinguish items from
each style.
